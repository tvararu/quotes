          Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the

          not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the
          life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you
          desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's

      <blockquote id="life">
        <p>
          The young man, who does not know the future, sees life as a kind of
          epic adventure, an Odyssey through strange seas and unknown islands,
          where he will test and prove his powers, and thereby discover his
          immortality.
        </p>

        <p>
          The man of middle years, who has lived the future that he once
          dreamed, sees life as a tragedy; for he has learned that his power,
          however great, will not prevail against those forces of accident and
          nature to which he gives the names of gods, and has learned that he is
          mortal.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the man of age, if he plays his assigned role properly, must see
          life as a comedy. For his triumphs and his failures merge, and one is
          no more the occasion for pride or shame than the other; and he is
          neither the hero who proves himself against those forces, nor the
          protagonist who is destroyed by them.

        <p>
          Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you

          have come alive.

      <blockquote id="appointed">
        <p>
          When someone reported to him that he was being tried in the Senate,
          Paconius was uninterested; he merely set off for his daily exercise
          and bath. When he was informed that he had been condemned, he asked
          whether it was to banishment or death. “To banishment,” came the
          reply. He then asked whether his property at Aricia had also been
          confiscated, and when he was told that it hadn’t, he replied, “Let us
          go to Aricia then and dine.” Epictetus holds this up as a model of
          Stoic behavior: “This is what it means to have rehearsed the lessons
          one ought to rehearse, to have set desire and aversion free from every
          hindrance and made them proof against chance. I must die. If
          forthwith, I die; and if a little later, I will take lunch now, since
          the hour for lunch has come, and afterwards I will die at the
          appointed time.”

        <p>
          Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores,
          and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much.
          But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it
          is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For
          nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man
          retire than into his own soul.

      <blockquote id="efficiency">
        <p>
          It will be said that while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not
          know how to fill their days if they had only four hours’ work out of
          the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world it is a
          condemnation of our civilisation; it would not have been true at any
          earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness
          and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of
          efficiency.

      <blockquote id="leisure">
        <p>
          The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing
          cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on.
          This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken
          up with work; if they had more leisure they would again enjoy
          pleasures in which they took an active part.

      <blockquote id="alienated">
        <p>
          A zoologist who observed gorillas in their native habitat was amazed
          by the uniformity of their life and their vast idleness. Hours and
          hours without doing anything. Was boredom unknown to them? This is
          indeed a question raised by a human, a busy ape. Far from fleeing
          monotony, animals crave it, and what they most dread is to see it end.
          For it ends, only to be replaced by fear, the cause of all activity.
          Inaction is divine; yet it is against inaction that man has rebelled.
          Man alone, in nature, is incapable of enduring monotony, man alone
          wants something to happen at all costs — something, anything. Thereby
          he shows himself unworthy of his ancestor: the need for novelty is the
          characteristic of an alienated gorilla.

          Because of that, if we were to be rational, it is the same thing as
          making us good, and that is the same thing as making us free.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not free in the sense of political freedom, being a slave or free man,
          but free in the sense of being autonomous. Making our own decisions.
          Making laws for ourselves. Free in the sense of no longer being a
          slave of our passions. Being pushed about by our feelings. Being a toy
          that gets messed with by arbitrary things that are, really, beneath
          the human condition, that are mere emotions.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we want to be fully human, we must be fully free, and that means
          fully rational, and that means fully good.
