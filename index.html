          The pursuit of something is often what makes it seem less attainable.

          Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could.
          Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon
          as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and
          with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The young man, who does not know the future, sees life as a kind of
          epic adventure, an Odyssey through strange seas and unknown islands,
          where he will test and prove his powers, and thereby discover his
          immortality.
        </p>

        <p>
          The man of middle years, who has lived the future that he once
          dreamed, sees life as a tragedy; for he has learned that his power,
          however great, will not prevail against those forces of accident and
          nature to which he gives the names of gods, and has learned that he
          is mortal.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the man of age, if he plays his assigned role properly, must see
          life as a comedy. For his triumphs and his failures merge, and one is
          no more the occasion for pride or shame than the other; and he is
          neither the hero who proves himself against those forces, nor the
          protagonist who is destroyed by them.

        <p>
          Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you
          come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people
          who have come alive.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          When someone reported to him that he was being tried in the Senate,
          Paconius was uninterested; he merely set off for his daily exercise
          and bath. When he was informed that he had been condemned, he asked
          whether it was to banishment or death. “To banishment,” came the
          reply. He then asked whether his property at Aricia had also been
          confiscated, and when he was told that it hadn’t, he replied, “Let us
          go to Aricia then and dine.” Epictetus holds this up as a model of
          Stoic behavior: “This is what it means to have rehearsed the lessons
          one ought to rehearse, to have set desire and aversion free from
          every hindrance and made them proof against chance. I must die. If
          forthwith, I die; and if a little later, I will take lunch now, since
          the hour for lunch has come, and afterwards I will die at the
          appointed time.”

        <p>
          Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores,
          and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much.
          But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it
          is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself.
          For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does
          a man retire than into his own soul.

        <p>
          It will be said that while a little leisure is pleasant, men would
          not know how to fill their days if they had only four hours’ work out
          of the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world it
          is a condemnation of our civilisation; it would not have been true at
          any earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for
          light-heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by
          the cult of efficiency.

        <p>
          The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing
          cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so
          on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully
          taken up with work; if they had more leisure they would again enjoy
          pleasures in which they took an active part.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A zoologist who observed gorillas in their native habitat was amazed
          by the uniformity of their life and their vast idleness. Hours and
          hours without doing anything. Was boredom unknown to them? This is
          indeed a question raised by a human, a busy ape. Far from fleeing
          monotony, animals crave it, and what they most dread is to see it
          end. For it ends, only to be replaced by fear, the cause of all
          activity. Inaction is divine; yet it is against inaction that man has
          rebelled. Man alone, in nature, is incapable of enduring monotony,
          man alone wants something to happen at all costs — something,
          anything. Thereby he shows himself unworthy of his ancestor: the need
          for novelty is the characteristic of an alienated gorilla.

          Because of that, if we were to be rational, it is the same thing as
          making us good, and that is the same thing as making us free.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not free in the sense of political freedom, being a slave or free
          man, but free in the sense of being autonomous. Making our own
          decisions. Making laws for ourselves. Free in the sense of no longer
          being a slave of our passions. Being pushed about by our feelings.
          Being a toy that gets messed with by arbitrary things that are,
          really, beneath the human condition, that are mere emotions.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we want to be fully human, we must be fully free, and that means
          fully rational, and that means fully good.
